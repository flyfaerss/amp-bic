## Dataset

Check [DATASET.md](DATASET.md) for instructions of dataset preprocessing.



## Training 

### Scene Graph Generation Model
In scripts/, we provide train and test instruction templates for VG, OI V6, GQA-LT.

We also provide the trained models (.pth and .sh) in [[model_zoo](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1kndK-j6FhZl7kmh14h5Uxg?pwd=69db)], which include the main results reported in our paper.
